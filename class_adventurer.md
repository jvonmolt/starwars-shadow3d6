## Adventurer Class

### Class Summary

Adventurers are swashbuckling scholars of the forgotten—field researchers who uncover ancient sites, wield exotic weapons, and speak dead languages. They are part explorer, part academic, part rogue. They traverse tombs, trade in alien relics, and navigate both libraries and lawless planets in search of truth, power, or profit. Sometimes the swash a buckle.
