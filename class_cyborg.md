## Cyborg Class

### Class Summary

A Cyborg strides into danger as a living fusion of flesh and circuitry, hacking hostile systems mid-battle while shrugging off blaster fire with subdermal plating. Whether ripping open sealed doors with servo-charged limbs or ghost-riding enemy droids through a neural uplink, this tech-savvy powerhouse turns every battlefield into its personal network.

### Basic Information

- **Hit Points:** 1d4 per level, rolled with advantage to reflect subdermal reinforcement and adaptive regeneration systems  
- **Armor:** Light or built-in armor only  
- **Weapons Allowed:** Small arms, vibro weapons, and built-in systems

### Core Abilities

#### MyMachine Interface

- +1 to INT checks to read transmissions or detect signals around you  
- In areas with droids, factories, or military data flows, you can passively monitor status and danger  
- Functions as an internal computer: stores voice/images and aids in decryption  
- Advantage on decryption and encryption attempts  

#### Cybernetic Aptitude

- Advantage on all tech-related checks: slicing, diagnostics, hacking, and mechanical repair  
- Can interface with droids to extract, alter, or disrupt programming (GM sets DC)  

#### Optional: Scomp Link Interface

- You may choose to sacrifice one hand for a built-in scomp connector  
- When connected to a data port, override machines/processes via INT check:  
  - Civilian system: DC 12  
  - Encrypted/military: DC 15–18 (GM sets based on complexity)  
  - Every roll, action, or exploit lowers the DC by 1

### Vulnerability: Ion & EMP Disruption

**Ion Weapon Hit:**  
- DC 13 CON save  
- Success: No effect  
- Failure: All cybernetic features (MyMachine, Scomp Link, talents) are disabled until a long rest with repair  

**EMP Exposure:**  
- DC 13 CON save  
- Success: Systems disrupted; disadvantage on all interface and tech rolls until repaired  
- Failure: Catastrophic loss; all cybernetic functions and interface-based talents are destroyed  
- Must complete a quest or invest resources to restore systems

### Roleplay Flavor

- **Lawful:** Rebellion-aligned unit—fighting for order, truth, and independence  
- **Neutral:** Rogue scavenger model—exploring identity and utility  
- **Chaotic:** Imperial experiment—unethical, aggressive, embedded with exploitative logic
