## Gunner Class

### Class Summary

Gunners are the backbone of ship and vehicle combat. With nerves of steel and eyes like targeting computers, they turn even clunky freighters into precision weapons platforms. From heavy blasters to ship-mounted turrets and proton torpedoes, gunners make their hits count—and if something explodes, even better.
