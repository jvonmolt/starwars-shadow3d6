## Infiltrator Class

### Class Summary

Infiltrators are masters of stealth, sabotage, and digital intrusion. Trained in silent movement, bypassing security, and exploiting distractions, they slice systems, slip past guards, and complete high-risk missions without triggering alarms. With no need for Force sensitivity, they rely on tech, reflexes, and sharp instincts.
