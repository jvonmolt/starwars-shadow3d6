## Roustabout Class

### Class Summary

The *Roustabout* is a gritty survivor from the back alleys of Nar Shaddaa, the dusty streets of Tatooine, or the crumbling ruins of forgotten Clone Wars outposts. They’re not soldiers, Jedi, or specialists—but they’re still standing when the dust settles.

This class represents the underdogs: drifters, scrap-dealers, washed-out guards, and con artists who’ve brushed with the Force but never trained in its discipline. Roustabouts have no formal combat training, yet they adapt fast, rely on street smarts, and cling to a sliver of innate Force sensitivity that grants them one growing power.

Mechanically, Roustabouts focus on survivability, luck, and minor Force use. They get one Force power early and slowly refine it over time, without ever becoming true Jedi. They wear light armor (vests, jackets), carry blasters or knives, and use cunning more than strength. A high roll on their talent table might grant them another Force power, but they'll never master the Force in full.

The Roustabout is for players who love roleplaying clever, scrappy underdogs that occasionally surprise everyone, including themselves.
