## Shooter Class

### Class Summary

Shooters are gunfighters, sharpshooters, and tactical operators. They thrive in the chaos of ranged combat—ducking behind cover, squeezing off precise blaster shots, and reacting quicker than most can blink. While they avoid close-quarters fighting, they dominate the battlefield from a distance, relying on skill, speed, and smart positioning.

### Core Abilities

#### Quick Draw

You have advantage on initiative rolls during ranged combat and may draw and fire a weapon in the same round without penalty.

#### Cover Tactician

While in cover, you gain +1 AC and advantage on difficulty checks against area-of-effect attacks (e.g., grenades, explosives).

#### Snap Shot

Once per combat, if you haven't moved during your turn, you may make a bonus attack with a light or one-handed ranged weapon.  
This attack is made at disadvantage unless you are in cover.
