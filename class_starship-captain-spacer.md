## Starship Captain Class / Spacer Class

### Class Summary

Starship Captains are charismatic tacticians, sharp navigators, and veteran spacers who bring calm in the chaos of hyperspace. Whether commanding a battle-hardened freighter or working as a seasoned crewmember, they sharpen the edge of any crew. Captains enhance hyperspace travel, boost morale, and lead from the front when boarders strike.

Spacers are equally skilled—navigators, quartermasters, and crew leads—but without a ship of their own (yet).

### Core Abilities

#### Hyperspace Navigation

Once per route setup, you may make a DC 15 Intelligence check.  
On success, reduce the number of actions required to plot a hyperspace jump by 1, allowing for faster escape or pursuit.

#### Sensor Jockey

+1 to DC WIS Initiative Checks if manning sensors on a Starship.  
Advantage on other sensors or scanning rolls.

#### Crew Commander

Once per round, make a DC 13 Charisma check.  
On success, grant +1 to a single crew member’s task roll this round (e.g., piloting, engineering, gunnery).

#### Hold the Line

When repelling boarders or in shipboard close-quarters combat, all allies in your party gain +1 to attack rolls as long as you’re conscious and fighting.
