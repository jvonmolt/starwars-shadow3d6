## Tech Class

### Class Summary

Techs are brilliant tinkerers, slicers, and battlefield technicians who bend machines to their will. They bypass locks, scramble security systems, pilot drones, and improvise defensive or offensive gadgets with astonishing skill. Unlike Cyborgs, Techs don’t modify their bodies—they rely on brainpower, tools, and fast hands to control the digital and mechanical battlefield.

### Core Abilities

#### System Override

You gain advantage on checks involving hacking, encryption, lockpicking, access override, and repair tasks using manual tools or interfaces.

#### Field Inventor

Once per long rest, given materials and uninterrupted time (10–30 minutes), you may invent a single-use gadget that creates a +2 effect in a small area.  
This can be offensive (e.g., a flash burst grenade, EM disruptor) or defensive (e.g., portable energy field, sensor jammer).  
The GM has final say on range, effect, and limits, but it must be simple, single-purpose, and tech-based.

#### Multi-Tool Master

You can always be assumed to have a basic toolkit and a pocket full of strange items, allowing you to attempt tech-based checks even when it seems very unlikely.
