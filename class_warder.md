## Warder Class

### Class Summary

Wielding the Force without a lightsaber, Warders master unarmed combat and supernatural agility. Their reflexes dodge blaster fire, their awareness predicts enemy strikes, and their discipline allows them to fight armored enemies with nothing but their hands—and the Force. Some are secretive temple disciples, others self-taught survivors with a natural connection to the living energy field.
