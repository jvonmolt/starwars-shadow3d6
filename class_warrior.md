## Warrior Class

### Class Summary

Warriors are the muscle of the battlefield—battle-hardened veterans, brutal enforcers, or gladiatorial champions who rely on raw power and elite martial training. Whether wielding vibroaxes, force pikes, or melee-enhanced armor, they charge headlong into conflict, shrugging off hits and delivering devastating strikes. The Warrior is the class for those who want to stand face-to-face with the enemy and win.

### Core Abilities

#### Martial Training

You may use all melee weapons, including heavy or two-handed weapons, with no penalties regardless of size or complexity. You also ignore weapon minimum strength requirements.

#### Brute Force

Once per combat, after a successful melee hit, you may roll an additional weapon damage die.  
This increases to twice per combat at level 5, and three times per combat at level 9.

#### Armor Mastery

When wearing heavy armor, you reduce incoming physical (non-energy) damage by 1.  
This stacks with other effects like shields or protection tiers.
