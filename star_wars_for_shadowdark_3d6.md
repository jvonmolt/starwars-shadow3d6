## Introduction - What is Star Wars for Shadowdark 3d6

Star Wars for Shadowdark 3d6 is a set of rules and dice Mechanics for creating tabletop role-playing games set in George Lucas and Disney's Star Wars universe. All Rights Reserved to them.

This work is for my personal Research into role-playing games.

This work is dedicated to a very good friend, Mike Griffus.

Shadowdark 3d6 is a variant of rules based on the popular Shadowdark RPG created by Kelsey Dion and published by the Arcane Library.  Shadowdark RPG © 2023 The Arcane Library, LLC. The following is what I am required to say and do, and I do so gladly.

*Shadowdark 3d6  is an independent product published under the Shadowdark RPG Third-Party License and is not affiliated with The Arcane Library, LLC.*

However, given the nature of the Star Wars content, I do not foresee publishing of any kind, and I regard that idea as highly unlikely.

The purpose of this game system is to determine if it's possible to create a fun game using the relatively simple (in terms of ease of use) Shadowdark style system, while still capturing the complexity and richness of a universe like Star Wars. My 50 Years of Gaming have taught me that a game is better to use 3d6 than a D20, which is the point of the alternate version that I use.

Better, in my humble opinion, is defined as predictable. The normal bell curve of a 3d6 roll allows players to make better decisions that have less chaotic outcomes. More predictability allows for better storytelling. I understand that a vast wave, perhaps the majority of all people interested in this Hobby, will disagree and like that level of Chaos.	 I’m ok with that.

## Basic Rules

### DC (Difficulty Check) (3d6 SCALE)

| Difficulty | DC (3d6) Example |
|---|---|
| Easy | DC 9 (bluff a lazy guard, leap a narrow chasm) |
| Normal | DC 12 (slip past a blockade patrol, slicing an older data port) |
| Hard | DC 15 (pilot through asteroid field, giving first aid to stop a character from dying) |
| Extreme | DC 18 (Smuggling weapons through Imperial inspection, Climbing a slippery cliff one-handed, getting the Emperor to change his mind) |

### Movement

The majority of characters can move within the Near (~30ft) range and then take an action. They can break their movement into segments, moving, then taking an action, taking an action, then moving, or any combination of movement portions. If a character skips taking an action, they may move a second time a Near distance.

### Range

Close = 5 feet. Near = up to 30 feet. Far = within sight (~150  ft.)

### Attack

To attack roll 3d6, add your modifier and compare this to your Target's AC. If the total is greater than or equal to the target’s AC, you have hit. Now you can roll damage according to the type of weapon you used.

By default, Melee weapons use your strength modifier as a bonus or penalty. Ranged weapons use your dexterity as a bonus or penalty. Any exceptions will be listed with the weapon. Small melee weapons may have an FN property indicating they can be used as a finesse weapon with your dexterity modifier.

On your turn, you may commit your action to assisting another team member, which gives them a +1  to their attack roll. Up to two people may assist one character, yielding a +2 to the attack roll. If your assistance is covering fire, Roll 3d6 to check for an energy cell drain.

### Defense

Your defense is the AC stat. For lighter armor, loose protective clothing, or protective robes, you will add your dexterity modifier to the Armor's AC. AC includes all of your dodging and blocking. There is no defense roll.

On your turn, you may commit your action to defense, which raises your AC by 2 until your next turn.

### Death, Death Timer, HP 0, Stabilize

When a player character win character reaches zero hit points, they roll a D4 plus their CON bonus/penalty. This is the number of rounds before they are dead beyond healing. This is often referred to as the death timer.

Each round, while they wait to die, other characters may make a DC intelligence 15 roll and the character will stabilize and get one hit point,t though not become conscious.

The character themself, each round while waiting to die on their initiative, may make a roll. If they roll a natural 18, they gain one hit point and may stand up. If they roll a natural 3  die instantly.

### **Cover**

Cover provides a defense bonus to a creature's Armor Class (AC) when it is partially obscured from attack. The rules state:

- **Half Cover:** +2 bonus to AC (e.g., behind a low wall or partial obstacle). \


- **Three-Quarters Cover:** +5 bonus to AC (e.g., peeking from around a corner or mostly obscured by a thick tree). \


- **Total Cover:** Cannot be targeted directly by attacks or spells (e.g., fully hidden behind a wall).

### Protection

Protection is an added layer on top of armor that can negate damage. Protection can negate the damage of a specific type of attack. For example, tier 2 protection stops all light attacks, such as fists, daggers, and clubs. Protection does not affect AC.

Protection is applied after a successful attack role on the target. The Target or the defender makes a percentile roll, and if that roll is equal to or less than the stop damage percent, the damage is negated.

Rarely do Ordinary People, non-military people, or their vehicles have protection.

Rarely do ordinary people, non-military personnel, or their vehicles receive protection. The following list was the Tiers of protection and their stop damage and Immunity effects.

#### Protection List

**Tier 0 — Stormtrooper armor**

- **Stops:** 1 % of incoming damage \


- **Immune to:** none \


- **Needs to be damaged by:** any weapon

**Tier 1 —  Vest, Loose protective clothes, loose protective robes, other wearable armor**

- **Stops:** 5 % of incoming damage \


- **Immune to:** none \


- **Needs to be damaged by:** any standard handheld weapon \


**Tier 2 — Heavy body armor (no DEX modifier)**

- **Stops:** 10 % \


- **Immune to:** light attacks, daggers, clubs, unarmed strikes \


- **Needs to be damaged by:** heavier handheld weapons (swords, blasters, etc.) \


**Tier 3 — Powered armor or light vehicles**

- **Stops:** 15 % \


- **Immune to:** most handheld weapons \


- **Needs to be damaged by:** heavy handheld weapons *or* light vehicle weapons \


**Tier 4 — Ground vehicles/starfighters**

- **Stops:** 20 % \


- **Immune to:** all handheld weapons \


- **Needs to be damaged by:** ground-vehicle-grade weapons (e.g., tank guns, light starfighter cannons) \


**Tier 5 — Starships**

- **Stops:** 25 % \


- **Immune to:** ground and handheld weapons \


- **Needs to be damaged by:** starship-class weapons (turbolasers, capital-ship missiles, etc.) \


* The paradox of stormtrooper armor is that it fails 100% of the time throughout shows and movies. Twice has it ever prevented damage from a shot among 2200 stormtroopers being hit across all media. But this means, of course, such bad armor would never be worn! Why would you improve yourself with it? It makes no sense. Our rule will be that it is weak, but it does work sometimes.

### Energy Shields

Energy Shields add buff AC points, with each attack, the buff lowers by one.  No more than 3 points of AC per round can be lowered. A short rest or repair DC 11 can restore 1 point of AC. Small craft may have only +1 to their AC, while a Dreadnought may have +10.

A **shield overload** could be a dynamic mechanic to reflect the cinematic blowouts we see in Star Wars battles. Here's a way to implement it in **Star Wars for Shadowdark 3d6**, maintaining balance and simplicity:


### Shield Overload

**Trigger Conditions (choose one or more):**

- The shield loses **all its AC bonus in a single round** if the shield generator is targeted and hit with 20% of HP points. \


- A **critical hit** (natural 18 on 3d6) penetrates the shield. \


- The target takes **5+ points over their AC** from a single attack. \


- Weapon deals **Ion or EMP damage** \


**Overload Effects (choose one or roll d4):**

| d4 | Overload Effect |
|---|---|
| 1 | Total Shutdown: Shield becomes inoperative until repaired (DC 13, 10 mins). |
| 2 | Feedback Shock: Defender takes 1d4 damage (non-lethal, ignores Protection). |
| 3 | Short Circuit: -1 to all checks for 1 minute (real time) due to system interference. |
| 4 | EMP Pulse: All nearby (close range) devices must succeed on DC 12 check or power down for 1 round. |

**Recovery Rule:**

- A **DC 15 Repair check** during combat can **reboot** an overloaded shield (takes one action and a toolkit). \


- Natural 18 on repair = restore all shield AC instantly.

#### The Unfamiliar Rule Penalty

A -4 to a roll if the character has not trained with the weapon, ship station, or vehicle controls, etc,  the character is operating. Only training can offset this penalty.
